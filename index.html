             <span class="more">Israel has some of the best food in the world. Fresh, bold, colorful. A culinary light unto the nations. Israelis have known this for a long time and it seems like the world has finally realized it too, thanks to beautiful and popular cookbooks by chefs like Yotam Ottolenghi, Sami Tamimi, Michael Solomonov and Einat Admoni, and thanks to the many award winning Israeli restaurants springing up like mushrooms after the rain in American and European cities.</br> 
             
             Naturally, on your visit to Israel, you’ll want to try it all. But it’s hard to know where to start.</br>
             And since the variety is so big, and there are so many different cuisines to sample, especially if you want to dive into the ethnic Jewish cuisines, I’m dividing my restaurant recommendations into three categories: The first focuses on chefs’ restaurants, specifically those with unique interpretations of local, Israeli or diaspora cuisine.</br>

             In the last 20 or so years, Israeli chefs realized they don’t need to look far for inspiration. Instead, they started looking inside their home kitchens, or more accurately, the kitchens of their grandmothers, and learning the secrets to the foods they grew up with. Those grandmothers came from all across the Jewish diaspora, from Morocco to Kurdistan, Libya, Iran and Turkey (not many Ashkenazi grandmothers have ignited a spark of culinary curiosity in Israel just yet). Talented chefs added their touch to the traditional cuisines of the Middle East, particularly the Palestinian and Mediterranean cuisines (mostly Italian). In other words, the new Israeli cuisine, is, well, Israeli.</br>

            If only the term “Israeli cuisine” were easy to explain, like French, or American.</br>

             What Israelis grasp intuitively as their local kitchen, is, in fact, a mix of practices and dishes brought to Israel from thousands of years of Jewish existence all around the world. And then there’s the local cuisine, with its Mediterranean ingredients and Middle Eastern techniques, warmly embraced by Israelis, but criticized by some as appropriating the Palestinian kitchen. In response to those accusations, I’d say that by now there are sufficient unique characteristics to distinguish Israeli cuisine and differentiate it from other Levantine kitchens.</br>  

            And now, even more than before, I feel that Israel’s best restaurants are those that have gone back even more to original recipes and refined them, not by making the dishes more complex, but by purifying and simplifying them.</br>
            
            There’s a lot to cover in such a short time.</br>

            It’s hard to choose from the long list of excellent restaurants, so I tried to focus on those that specialize in Israeli cuisine (interestingly, always with a touch of Italian influence), something that would be hard to find outside the country and would hopefully complement the Israeli trip experience. Here are several chef restaurants worth trying in Tel Aviv, and one in Jerusalem.</br></span>
